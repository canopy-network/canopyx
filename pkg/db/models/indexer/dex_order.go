// DexOrder represents a versioned snapshot of a DEX limit order.
// DEX orders are AMM-based cross-chain swaps that go through a batch lifecycle.
// Snapshots are created at each state transition (future -> locked -> complete).
//
// Lifecycle States:
// - future: Order appears in next-dex-batch (not yet locked for execution)
// - locked: Order appears in dex-batch (locked for execution at this height)
// - complete: EventDexSwap fired, order executed with final amounts and success status
//
// The snapshot-on-change pattern works correctly with parallel/unordered indexing because:
// - Initial state comes from RPC (DexBatch or NextDexBatch at height H)
// - Final state comes from events at height H describing orders from H-1
// - ReplacingMergeTree handles deduplication if the same height is indexed multiple times
//
// Note: Order creation time is tracked via the dex_order_created_height materialized view,
// which calculates MIN(height) for each order_id. Consumers should JOIN with this view
// if they need to know when an order was created.
