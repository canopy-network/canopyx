// DexWithdrawal represents a versioned snapshot of a DEX liquidity withdrawal.
// Liquidity providers withdraw their tokens based on their pool points percentage.
// Snapshots are created at each state transition (pending -> complete).
//
// Lifecycle States:
// - pending: Withdrawal appears in dex-batch or next-dex-batch (not yet processed)
// - complete: EventDexLiquidityWithdrawal fired, withdrawal processed with final amounts
//
// The snapshot-on-change pattern works correctly with parallel/unordered indexing because:
// - Initial state comes from RPC (DexBatch or NextDexBatch at height H)
// - Final state comes from events at height H describing withdrawals from H-1
// - ReplacingMergeTree handles deduplication if the same height is indexed multiple times
//
// Note: Withdrawal creation time is tracked via the dex_withdrawal_created_height materialized view,
// which calculates MIN(height) for each order_id. Consumers should JOIN with this view
// if they need to know when a withdrawal was created.
