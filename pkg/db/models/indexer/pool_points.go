// PoolPointsByHolder represents a versioned snapshot of a liquidity provider's pool points.
// Pool points represent ownership shares in a DEX liquidity pool, determining the proportion
// of trading fees earned and the amount received when withdrawing liquidity.
//
// Snapshots are created when:
// - EventDexLiquidityDeposit: Points increase after successful deposit
// - EventDexLiquidityWithdrawal: Points decrease after successful withdrawal
//
// Uses snapshot-on-change pattern: a new row is created only when a holder's points change.
// This enables temporal queries like "What were Alice's pool points at height 5000?" while
// using significantly less storage than storing all holders at every height.
//
// The snapshot-on-change pattern works correctly with parallel/unordered indexing because:
// - We query RPC PoolPoints at height H (after event execution)
// - We don't rely on database state which may be incomplete during parallel indexing
// - ReplacingMergeTree handles deduplication if the same height is indexed multiple times
//
// Note: Pool points holder creation time is tracked via the pool_points_created_height
// materialized view, which calculates MIN(height) for each (address, pool_id) pair.
